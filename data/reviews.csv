392006739,2438119712,5,The cost was good when you need esr buds on the go underabnormal circumstances or just for kids who msy damage or frequently lose some. Some is good not great...connecting was easy,positive,1,0
394179534,2438119712,1,"they're too big to fit in my ears.  A lot of static.

Please stop pressuring me to buy more of these.  I DON'T LIKE THE PAIR I HAVE",negative,0,1
394808229,5321127916,5,I always love how beats earbuds sound. quality is decent for the price. battery last the whole day. fast charging is a big plus.  the only downside is that  the case doesn't have a charging feature :(  cannot charge your buds unless they're connected to a  cable. overall is good.,positive,1,0
392648145,5321127916,1,"I am shocked to say that with 100% honesty, the volume and sound quality  of these  headphones match those of the dollar tree. I'm baffled. I was so excited about the purchase.  Now I'm out 10 dollars for express delivery,  and driver tip because these are going back!!",negative,0,1
387601360,6557751127,4,"Sound quality is good. It is not waterproof. It can handle sweat, but I don't think it can handle being in the water battery. Life is about six hours of solid music play easy to connect. The fit is less to be desired. It falls out easily if you're looking downward, also it comes loose if you were talking or chewing gum, the price is affordable for calls the sound quality of what I hear is very clear however, the person I'm speaking to has a hard time hearing me. I would definitely recommend if you're looking for something quick you do get what you pay for nice purchase.",positive,1,0
391132998,6557751127,1,"Terrible headphones. On the off-chance they stay in the my ears at all, they're painful and the sound is barely audible. Secondly, the instructions are in broken English, with some unintuitive touch controls that cause tracks to skip and pause, or change volume if you need to adjust them (which is all the time). They were easy to connect, but that's a low bar that all my headphones have always achieved.",negative,0,1
387160324,11381374703,5,Obviously these work great. Logistically it was  eye opening. Went to purchase at store…price is higher in store than on website. Store not allowed to match; so left to order online. Not sure why in store shoppers are “punished” with higher prices. Not much sympathy for stores that want you to shop in the brick %26 mortar stores when they play these games!,positive,1,0
362568947,11381374703,1,"Walmart is very inconvenient, I ordered AirPods and specifically ASKED them to follow directions so my package won't get stolen , they ignored what I asked for and someone stole my package. They made me wait for a refund and after 13 business days they told me that my refund dispute was denied %26 that I couldn't get a refund , so I basically wasted $140 I hate Walmart seriously very unprofessional and a waste of my money .",negative,0,1

394795968,16513673629,5,this is an amazing headset and great sound quality and the ear buds are so light weight and very easy to activate. to total case with bud is like so lite compared to my samsung buds 2 and i love the sound.,positive,1,0
377761066,1496314895,5,"Even though I searched for the lowest priced set of Ear Buds that has a Microphone built-in for use with a cell phone, I was very surprised at not only how well these are made, but how comfortable they are when wearing them for prolonged times. (I occasionally have lengthy phone calls)

They come with two sizes of replaceable ear fittings made of soft rubber for a secure fit and feel.

They sound very good and my friend says my audio mic when using the cell phone sounds very good also.

I don't like using Bluetooth or any wireless ear buds because the mic sounds thin to the caller and since I don't use them often, they are never ""at the ready"" and always seem to need charging or run out of energy prematurely. 
 
I'm happy and recommend them even if you're not a broke cheapskate like me!",positive,1,0
363078040,1496314895,1,These do not work. Don’t waste your money. First day I used them they would turn on and off and the sound was very crackly. I tried again and bought another pair. Same thing happened. I wasted my money twice and it won’t happen a third time.,negative,0,1
387039293,1415071964,5,"these are so lightweight and comfortable that they do not interfere with your glasses. I wear them in the shower with no problem. the day I got them, I showed they to family and ordered 2 more sets that day! the sound quality is good for not being in the ear. you can not beat them, for the price, its a great buy!",positive,1,0
391114264,1415071964,1,"these aren't good. ig idk what i expected. i was too impatient to wait until my next paycheck to just get a new pair of airpods, so i got these. i regret every decision ive made in my life. the sound quality just isn't good because it's not in your ear, which is the point ig. people like how they don't hurt your ears, but i don't like how they feel at all. they say they're noise canceling… 🤨 no they aren't. they don't cancel ANY noise. maybe i'm not wearing them right, but i'm following the little picture in the very vague manual. just don't waste your money on these.",negative,0,1
376567552,631193073,5,"I refuse to buy anything other than Jlabs. My only issue is I have ADD and lose them all the time. I gotta be one of their favorite customers since Ive bought so many new ones just cause I cant keep track of my stuff  🤣. 

Love them, Cant wait till I can afford the new crystal/see thru ones!",positive,1,0
380745782,631193073,1,"Frustrated to find have no way to charge the case because the tiny cord attached is a usb-c plug, which is not what was advertised, and there is no warning that most people would need a special adapter to plug this into a port to charge it. And further research shows that they sell those adapters on their site, but to add salt they are sold out. So what should have been a pleasant experience to buy new earbuds has become a giant aggravation in finding out what the problem is and how to solve it. Which seems could all have been less of a mess if they had been honest to what you  are buying, and at the very least having some warning somewhere that you may need a special adaptor. On top of paying for these I have had to pay another company to  ship me an adaptor that will work. So I don’t even know if it’s going to work, will just have to wait and see. What a mess. Shady too. Wasted money and time dealing with all this. Over it.",negative,0,1
